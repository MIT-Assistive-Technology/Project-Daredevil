# Quick Fix Summary

## Problem
PyOpenAL had import issues because:
1. Virtual environment was not activated
2. Library path for OpenAL wasn't set up

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created symlink for OpenAL library
```bash
ln -sf /opt/homebrew/Cellar/openal-soft/1.24.3/lib/libopenal.dylib /opt/homebrew/lib/libopenal.dylib
```

### 2. Always activate virtual environment
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Verify installation
```bash
python3 -c "import openal; print('OK')"
```

## Current Status

The spatial audio module is implemented but needs some API adjustments for PyOpenAL version compatibility. The core logic is complete.

## Workaround: Use Detection + Depth Only

For now, you can use the detection + depth stream without spatial audio:

```bash
source env/bin/activate
python3 depth/detection_depth_stream.py --classes person bottle cup
```

This will show you objects with depth information, and you can add spatial audio later when the PyOpenAL API issues are resolved.

## Next Steps

1. The spatial audio module API calls need to be updated to match your PyOpenAL version
2. Alternative: Use a different spatial audio library (like pyaudio with manual HRTF)
3. Alternative: Use simpler stereo panning as a temporary solution

## Files Created

- `spatial-audio/index.py` - Spatial audio engine
- `spatial-audio/integration.py` - Integration with detection/depth
- `spatial-audio/README.md` - Documentation
- `spatial-audio/SETUP.md` - Setup guide
- `spatial-audio/run_test.sh` - Test script
- `spatial-audio/__init__.py` - Package init

All the infrastructure is in place, just needs API compatibility fixes for PyOpenAL.
